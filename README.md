# supp-bois

A snake created for our first ever Battle Snake competition (2018). It's a hungry snake that uses A* to gobble up all the food. He managed to advance to the second round, but his hunger couldn't be satiated and he ended up eating his own tail.

The name is a play on words. On the surface it seems to mean 'what's up boys', however, in Punjabi snake is pronounced like 'sapa', so essentially the name also means snake-boy.

In his next iteration maybe he'll be a be a snake-man 🐍
